# Neon Convergence

**Neon Convergence** is an interactive art experience and one of my **creative coding** studies. Inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics, the project stands out for its vibrant neon colors and the ability to generate dynamic visual compositions. Using the **p5.js** library, it creates geometric shapes that move and realign around the mouse cursor, allowing the viewer to become an active participant in creating a constantly shifting visual symphony.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

**Neon Convergence** blends interactive art and **creative coding**, exploring how movement and color can create a unique visual experience. The project uses rectangles in neon pink, electric blue, deep purple, and neon green. These rectangles are semi-transparent, allowing for dynamic overlaps and chromatic blending. As the mouse moves across the screen, the geometric shapes gather around the cursor, creating a futuristic visual choreography.

### ðŸ–¼ Aesthetic and Theme

- **Style**: Cyberpunk, influenced by digital art and creative coding.
- **Interactivity**: The user directly interacts with the visual composition, controlling the movement of rectangles with the mouse.
- **Colors**: Neon pink, electric blue, deep purple, and neon green.
- **Theme**: The fusion of man and machine in a digital, immersive visual space.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Languages**: HTML5, JavaScript
- **Library**: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub Pages for deployment
